# Citi Bike Bikesharing in NYC

## Purpose

To analyze data from the bike rental company Citi Bike in New York City in order to determine if a comparable company would be successful in Des Moines.

## Results

### Duration x All Riders
![D2.1] (https://github.com/cewarkentin/bikesharing/blob/main/D2.1.png)

Most bikes are checked out between 0-60 minutes. Most bikes are checked out for only around 10 minutes.

### Duration x Riders by Gender
![D2.2] (https://github.com/cewarkentin/bikesharing/blob/main/D2.2.png)

Bike rider gender does not greatly impact bike rental time-- most bikes are checked out for only around 10 minutes, regardless of the gender of the rider.

### August Peak Bike Usage Hours

Considering that most bikes are checked out for less than an hour, we can use either start time or stop time to approximate the peak hours of rental bike usage. Bikes are generally used during the day, with peak usage around "traffic times" before and after work hours.

### Hourly Bike Usage
![D2.3] (https://github.com/cewarkentin/bikesharing/blob/main/D2.3.png)

Bike usage follows general car traffic hours-- busy before work and after work, starting to get busy a little earlier on Friday afternoons. Weekends are busiest in the middle of the day when people are going on free-day outings.

### Hourly Bike Usage by Gender
![D2.4] (https://github.com/cewarkentin/bikesharing/blob/main/D2.4.png)

Comparable to the previous image in terms of determining hourly bike usage. Men and women are not using the bikes for any obvious different purposes.

### Daily Bike Usage by Gender, by User Type
![D2.5] (https://github.com/cewarkentin/bikesharing/blob/main/D2.5.png)

There are more male subscribers than female subscribers. Additionally, as seen in the previous image, men use the bikes more than the women.

### Bike User Subscription Information

The majority of Citi Bike users are subscribers to the service and likely regular users of the bikes.

## Summary

More information about the Des Moines population and city structure would be helpful in drawing comparisons between success in New York City versus success in Des Moines. With more information about the demographics that pass through Des Moines (locals, folks employed in the city, vacationers, etc.), we could create additional visualizations to help identify if the populations are appropriately comparable.

Without this information, I do not feel that I can answer the purpose of the data analysis.
