# Citi Bike Bikesharing in NYC

## Purpose

To analyze data from the bike rental company Citi Bike in New York City in order to determine if a comparable company would be successful in Des Moines.

## Results

###

## Summary

More information about the Des Moines population and city structure would be helpful in drawing comparisons between success in New York City versus success in Des Moines. With more information about the demographics that pass through Des Moines (locals, folks employed in the city, vacationers, etc.), we could create additional visualizations to help identify if the populations are appropriately comparable.

Without this information, I do not feel that I can answer the purpose of the data analysis.
